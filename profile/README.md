# The Soul Machine Learning Framework

Soul is far from a usable state - come back in a year or so.

Current Goals:

Target High-Performance-Computing platforms for Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning

Create an Interface in Rust that is easy to learn, use, and understand.

Provide extensive documentation.

Be a learning tool for both HPC and Machine Learning for years to come.
